# Yomento Technical Test

This is React Native app based on the technical test set out by Yomento. The app aims to recreate the home page of the current Yomento app, including the scroll functionality of the small and large image containers.

**Built on**

- React Native
- Styled Components

**Testing Utilities**

- Jest

**Running the app**

To run the project you will need to clone down this repo. To do that, click on the copy link and on your machine, in your Terminal, type `git clone` followed by the link.

Navigate inside the directory and type `npm install`.

Once completed, type `expo start` to run the application.

You will also need to download the Expo app to your mobile from your designated app store.

Once you've done that, Expo's metro bundler will have opened in your browser. Open your camera application with your phone and point the camera at the QR code displayed on the screen. This will prompt the Expo app to open and display the app on your phone.

**To be completed**

If given more time, I would add or do the following:

- More robust testing
- Test on both Android and IOS (Currently only tested on IOS, unable to test on Android due to lack of device)
- Find a work around for Font issue. The fonts recommended to be used in the technical brief are both paid fonts so I chose to implement Roboto instead as it's a similar font. However, Styled Components and Expo fonts seem to have compatibility issues and don't work correctly. Due to this no global fonts have been installed. I have opened a case with Expo and Styled Components for them to fix the issue with their tech
